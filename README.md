# Rocket Mayhem (GMTK 2021 Submission)
A game submission for the GMTK 2021 Game Jam, made in around 10 hours.

Windows Jam Version is broken, and the WebGL is too easy because of last minute number changes that i overlooked.
This version is a more updated version with better numbers and not broken like the windows version.

# What's Rocket Mayhem?
Rocket mayhem is a game where you play as a space rocket driver, and you have to control all three rockets to get onto outer space, but each rocket engine has a limtied amount of fuel, if you use them all at once you won't be able to get far! 

Rocket Mayhem is about managing your engine's resources to try and get as far as you can get.
